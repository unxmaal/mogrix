# chrpath package rules for IRIX cross-compilation
package: chrpath

rules:
  # make install puts docs in $(prefix)/doc/chrpath-0.16/ which differs from
  # rpmbuild's %doc handling. The spec's cleanup targets /usr/doc but our
  # prefix is /usr/sgug, so docs end up as unpackaged files.
  install_cleanup:
    - "rm -rf %{buildroot}%{_prefix}/doc"
