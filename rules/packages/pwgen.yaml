# pwgen - password generator
# Uses getopt_long but doesn't use autoconf — plain Makefile with manual configure.
# The compat injection adds getopt_long to LIBS but pwgen's Makefile doesn't
# use autoconf-style LIBS. Need to inject via LDFLAGS or prep_commands.
package: pwgen

rules:
  prep_commands:
    # pwgen's configure is hand-written, not autoconf. It doesn't honor LIBS.
    # Patch Makefile.in to link against getopt_long compat object.
    - "sed -i 's|^LDFLAGS.*=.*|& @LIBS@|' Makefile.in"
